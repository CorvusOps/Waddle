# Waddle

Waddle was developed by a group of 6 of Computer Science students from Polytechnic University of the Philippines. The idea for the name came from a duck song hence, WADDLE was adapted. Waddle is the way a duck walks, like a walk in a park with firmness but still with a bit of clumsiness. As, they want this programming language/compiler to be as simple as possible with a little most error they can make.
